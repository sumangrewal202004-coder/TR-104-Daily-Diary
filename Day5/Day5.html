    <h1>Day 5 Learning Summary</h1>

    <h2>Revision Session of HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>
        On Day 5, a revision session was conducted to review the concepts of HTML and CSS that
        were taught earlier. This session helped in strengthening the understanding of core
        concepts and clearing any doubts related to web development basics.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the revision, the structure of an HTML document, commonly used tags, and the role
        of CSS in styling web pages were discussed. Important topics such as elements, attributes,
        selectors, and the box model were revised to reinforce the fundamentals.
    </p>

    <h2>Topics Revised</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML document structure</li>
        <li>Basic and semantic HTML tags</li>
        <li>CSS selectors and properties</li>
        <li>Box model and layout basics</li>
        <li>Responsive design fundamentals</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Learning</h2>
    <p>
        Along with the revision, guidance was provided on upcoming topics. In the future, more
        advanced concepts of HTML and CSS will be covered, followed by JavaScript to build
        interactive and dynamic web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        This revision session was useful in building confidence and ensuring a strong foundation
        for future learning.
